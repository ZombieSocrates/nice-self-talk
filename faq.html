    <h1 class="question-header">Why did you build this?</h1>
    <div class="question-response">The designer behind this app is privileged enough to work with bright, creative, and motivated people who attack difficult challenges with confidence and joy. Even so, in the heat of difficult moments, he noticed these awesome people taking out their frustrations on themselves&mdash;<i>I'm stupid, I'm an idiot, I'm so dumb</i>&mdash;and wondered if there was a way to help catch people in these negative moments to help them be kinder to themselves.

    Whether you learned a <a href="https://www.developgoodhabits.com/fixed-mindset-vs-growth-mindset/" target="_blank">fixed mindset instead of a growth mindset</a> growing up, or just need something to help boost positivity and morale in stressful moments, PepTalk Bismol is here to provide an automated nudge in a kind direction.

    <h1 class="question-header">Isn't passive listening creepy?</h1>
    <div class="question-response">Thank you for raising that concern; it's one we share and take seriously. Here's a few things that we can say on this point:
      <p></p>
      <ul class="response-list">
        <li class="response-bullet">PepTalk Bismol only listens when you switch on the widget on its main page and can be turned off at any time.</li>
        <li class="response-bullet">PepTalk Bismol only keeps track of the 100 most recent words it has heard in the background.</li>
        <li class="response-bullet">As soon as you switch off PepTalk Bismol, it deletes any of the words it has heard <i>without saving them to any permanent storage.</i></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p></p>
    <h1 class="question-header">Does this work in all browsers?</h1>
    <div class="question-response">PepTalk Bismol was primarly developed for Google Chrome, but the core speech recognition functionality should work in Firefox as well. Ideas on how to expand this to other platforms are welcome!</div>
    <p></p>
    <h1 class="question-header">What else could this do?</h1>
    <div class="question-response">While the intent of PepTalk Bismol is to be small in scope, here are a couple of future features that we see as highly feasible and potentially desirable.
      <p></p>
      <ul class="response-list">
        <li class = "response-bullet">What if PepTalk Bismol let you <b>control</b> what types of negative phrases it listened for to match your own patterns of speech?</li>
        <li class="response-bullet">What if it let you <b>customize</b> the pep talks that it gave back, potentially allowing you to upload messages from your friends and loved ones?</li>
        <li class="response-bullet">If PepTalk Bismol <i>did</i> track some form of historical data about what it does or doesn't hear, could it help you set and achieve rewards (<i>e.g. 40 hour streak of no putdowns! Great job!</i>)</li>
      </ul>
